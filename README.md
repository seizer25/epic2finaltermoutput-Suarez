# epic2finaltermoutput-Suarez

I created my mandala output using p5.js Web Editor. The design I did was from the famous anime Naruto Shippuden. I am not that good in codings but with the help of youtube and P5.Js refference I made my own version of sharingan eye. There is no hidden message on my work, I'm not even a fan of animes but I think this design is a good idea to be practicing with. As I was making progress on my work I enjoyed making it until it is done.

These are the references that I used for making the mandala output: https://youtu.be/se9rsp2VMWk https://youtu.be/GYFiu7nLTak https://youtu.be/hISICBkFa4Q

If there was no pandemic I would like to discover more about Game Design.
